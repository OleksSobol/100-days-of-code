# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Start building portfolio using W3.CSS framework and in the same time learning this framework))).

**Thoughts:** Compare to Bootstrap framework, W3.CSS really easy, I am not saying Bootstrap hard, just difficult to understand from beginnig.
